In this project on crime data analysis, I conducted a thorough investigation, starting with data cleaning where I addressed missing values, performed data type conversions, and applied outlier detection. My approach ensured data integrity and set the foundation for reliable analysis.
In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, I visualized overall crime trends, identified seasonal patterns, and examined specific crime types and their trends over time. Key findings included an upward trend in reported crimes, higher average crime rates during fall, and the identification of Battery Simple Assault as the most common crime type. My analysis extended to investigating regional differences in crime rates, exploring correlations between economic factors and crime rates, and studying the relationship between the day of the week and certain crimes. I also delved into the impact of major events, such as the COVID-19 lockdown, on crime rates. In the final part, I developed a time series forecasting model using the ARIMA to predict future crime trends
